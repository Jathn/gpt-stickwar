# GPT-Stickwar

## Test

I've been using GPT models in coding for a bit now, and just wanted to test the current state. to do this I used gpt in form of openais chatpgt and github copilot.

I wanted to simply prompt until it was clear that the project was not really progressing any further, since the context was lost. Starting a new chat would have blown all progress and understanding away.

The outline I had:

- A guy standing in a 800 x 600 window holding a red stick on a black background.
- Movement by WASD

After some refactoring:
 - An enemy chases you
 - much cleaner code without 5000 if statements

Summary:

It is really easy to get started with new tooling, if you have a basic computer literacy (for safety as well) and a generative model. 
You can get all these "base configs" set up really really fast, and focus on the logic until configurations become relevant again.

It is really fun to try out new things, since you can generativelly produce a "sandbox" in pretty much any language or framework.

Still, after all this time. I know I probably wasn't super in my prompting and I'm not claiming to use the best of best, but gpt-4o seems to lack in some areas.
1. Losing track of progress and the big picture really quick. 2. Code wise, it doesn't perform very idiomatically. Wrote me 5 if statements for the same conditional in a row. (There was a default case)
